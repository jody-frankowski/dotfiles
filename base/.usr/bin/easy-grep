# Custom script to make rg match words in any order
# Usage: easy-grep [word ...]

# /!\ Warning: If called with "--color=always" `easy-grep abc cd` won't match "abcdef" because "abc"
# will be enclosed in ANSI color codes, making the string look like "COLOR-CODEabcCOLOR-CODEdef" and
# so the last rg (for "cd") won't be able to match.
